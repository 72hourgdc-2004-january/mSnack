    Keys:

    Arrow Keys: run, jump
    Space Bar: attack
    Alt: Brutal Eating Frenzy!
    F1: toggle fullscreen/window
    F2: toggle scanlines/normal mode



    What's the deal?

    Alright, you are a man-eating freak who needs to feed constantly, so kill everyone that stands in your way, and eat them when they're down!...but beware, these fatsos carry around FOOD and they will attack you on sight.
    The blue bar is your Vital Meter, it goes down when you are hit and it starts decreasing when your Blood Meter is empty.
    The red bar is your Blood Meter, it decreases constantly, as your hunger increases. Eat people to recover blood.



    Characters:
